# CV-final-project
Food classification project for CV Fall 2019

In this work, we will use reduced-size Food101 data set. We will first apply AlexNet\cite{Alex12} modal designed by Alex Krizhevsky in 2012 to extract features. Then, we will use fully connected layers to classify images into 55 food categories. We will discuss different activation functions performance for our data set, and experiments how the food classification and calorie detection works for real image taken in our daily life.
